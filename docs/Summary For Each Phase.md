## Phase 3:

- **ChatGPT Integration**:
  - Shared the full project plan with ChatGPT.
  - Informed ChatGPT of what was completed in Phase 1 and Phase 2, specifically what was missed (eslint and email/password auth).
  - Shared the entire codebase and project structure.
  - Asked ChatGPT for guidance on what to do in Phase 3, maintaining the current structure.
  - Improved the front-end with version 0.
  - **Separate Branch Workflow**:
    - The improvements were made in a separate branch and confirmed to be working correctly via Vercel.
    - Once confirmed, the separate branch was merged into the main branch.

- **Skipped Step**:
  - Did not implement "Shared: extract CRUD helper if reused â‰¥ 3 times."

## Phase 4:

- **Habit Slice Integration**:
  - Created `habits.ts` and `habits.d.ts` files following the Supabase table structure.
  - Discussed with ChatGPT, providing the full project plan and asking for guidance on what files should not be created for Slice 4 based on the documentation.
  - Updated the dashboard to integrate both the Task and Habit slices.

- **Skipped Step**:
  - Did not implement "Shared: move any reused calendar/date logic to core/date-utils.ts."

## Phase 5:

- **Built Entirely with Cursor**:
  - Completed Phase 5 with full integration of Cursor.

## Phase 6:

- **Collaborative Build with Cursor**:
  - Shared the complete project document with Cursor.
  - Shared the "Broken Into Vertical Slices" document.
  - Informed Cursor about what was implemented in each slice and what was missed.
  - Decided to implement Phase 6 in steps to avoid implementing everything at once.
  - Worked collaboratively with Cursor, debugging and testing as the phase progressed.
  - Built rules for cursor. Cursor followed the rules and the official docs.
  - Phase 6 was completed with the help of Cursor and ChatGPT for debugging.

## Phase 7 & 8:

- **Completed and Debugged**:
  - Phase 7 was completed and debugged using both Cursor and ChatGPT.
  - Supporting documentation was attached for reference.
