# Habit Tracking Guide (for Users)

## 🔄 Habit Tracking Logic Explained

Our habit tracker supports daily, weekly, and monthly habits. Here’s how it works:

### 🗓️ Daily Habits

- **Example**: Drink water
- **Goal Target**: 7

**Meaning**: You aim to complete this habit once every day for a total of 7 days in the current week.

- ✅ Complete the habit on each day (e.g., Mon–Sun).
- Progress is based on how many days you check off each week.

---

### 📆 Weekly Habits

- **Example**: Go to the gym
- **Goal Target**: 4

**Meaning**: You aim to complete the habit at least once each week, for 4 different weeks in the current month.

- ✅ You don’t need to complete it multiple times per week. Just once in each week is enough to count that week as completed.

---

### 📅 Monthly Habits

- **Example**: Volunteer work
- **Goal Target**: 6

**Meaning**: You aim to complete the habit at least once each month, across 6 months.

- ✅ Completing it once during the month counts that entire month as done.
- We show the last 6 months to help you track this goal.
