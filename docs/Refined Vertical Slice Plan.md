# 🚀 Vertical Slice Product Strategy (Refined for Scalability & Maintainability

This document outlines a production-grade strategy for a solo founder building a scalable SaaS using vertical slices. It focuses on rapid iteration, maintainability, and minimal technical debt.

---

## 🧩 Strategy Overview

- **Build vertical slices**: End-to-end features including UI, API, and DB logic—fully deployable and self-contained. This allows for fast feedback, focused scope, and reduced complexity.

- **Use a Kanban board to manage flow**:
  - **To Do**: Prioritized, dependency-aware backlog
  - **In Progress**: Active slice(s) within WIP limit (1–2 max)
  - **Testing**: Slice is functionally complete, under test/review
  - **Done**: Fully deployed, tested, and validated in production

---

## ✅ Milestone Roadmap (Phase-Based)

Each phase delivers user-visible functionality with attention to shared utilities, test coverage, and long-term structure.

### 🔹 Phase 1: Foundation & Deployment

**Goals**: Scaffold, configure, and deploy a clean base stack.

- ✅ Next.js (TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui)
- ✅ Font: Inter
- ✅ Linting & formatting: Prettier
- ✅ CI: GitHub Actions
- ✅ Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + RLS)
- ✅ Deploy "hello world" to Vercel

**Outcome**: Production-deployed, structured app ready for features.

---

### 🔹 Phase 2: Auth + Onboarding Slice

**Goals**: Complete sign-up/login flow.

- ✅ UI: email + OAuth login (with Supabase)
- ✅ DB & API: auth tokens, RLS policies
- ✅ Middleware: protect routes
- ✅ Shared utilities: validation, JWT, auth client in `core/`

**Outcome**: Authenticated users reach protected `/dashboard`.

---

### 🔹 Phase 3: Task Management Slice

**Goals**: Create and list tasks.

- ✅ DB: tasks table + Supabase queries
- ✅ UI: task creation form + list display
- ✅ Logic: status toggle, filtering
- ✅ Shared: extract CRUD helper if reused ≥ 3 times

**Outcome**: Task CRUD flows working with real-time updates.

---

### 🔹 Phase 4: Habit Tracking Slice

**Goals**: Track habits over time.

- ✅ DB: habits + habit_events tables
- ✅ UI: form + calendar tracker
- ✅ Shared: move any reused calendar/date logic to `core/date-utils.ts`

**Outcome**: Users can track and view daily/weekly habits.

---

### 🔹 Phase 5: UI Polish & Shared UX Framework

**Goals**: Establish a consistent design system.

- ✅ UI: dark mode, animation (Framer Motion)
- ✅ Modularize: atomic or layered components in `components/`
- ✅ Accessibility: pass WCAG AA, keyboard nav, ARIA

**Outcome**: Cohesive, accessible, polished UI across slices.

---

### 🔹 Phase 6: Analytics & Streaks Slice

**Goals**: Provide performance insights to users.

- ✅ API: calculate streaks, stats, aggregate summaries
- ✅ UI: charts (Recharts), date filters, CSV export
- ✅ Shared: abstract chart config if reused (e.g., `core/chart-utils.ts`)

**Outcome**: Live, filterable dashboard of user habits and performance.

---

### 🔹 Phase 7: Real-Time & Notifications Slice

**Goals**: Live feedback and messaging.

- ✅ Supabase: channel subscriptions
- ✅ UI: toast notifications
- ✅ Shared: reusable toast logic in `core/toast.ts`

**Outcome**: Real-time sync and feedback for key actions.

---

### 🔹 Phase 8: Testing, Performance, & Infrastructure

**Goals**: Hardening for production.

- ✅ Tests: Jest, React Testing Library, Supabase integration
- ✅ Shared test utils: `test-utils/`
- ✅ Audits: Lighthouse CI, a11y testing
- ✅ Monitoring: Vercel Web Vitals, Sentry
- ✅ CI enforcement: type checks, test pass, lint

**Outcome**: A robust, testable, and observable product.

## 📚 System Conventions

### 🔁 Shared Logic Strategy

**❗ Don’t extract prematurely.** Apply the Rule of 3: only move to `core/` after usage in 3+ places.

- ✅ Centralize non-feature-specific logic in `core/`:
  - `core/auth.ts`: JWT, auth clients
  - `core/date-utils.ts`: recurring logic, date formatting
  - `core/crud.ts`: generic DB helpers (if applicable)
  - `core/toast.ts`: UI notification system

### 🌐 Cross-Slice Communication

- **Keep slices isolated**.
- Use:
  - ✅ Internal APIs (e.g., `/api/streaks`)
  - ✅ Event-based flow via Supabase channels or internal emitters
  - ✅ Shared utilities for cross-slice helpers (e.g., date math)

### 🎯 Granularity & WIP Control

- **Each slice** = 1 user-facing capability (e.g., "track a habit", "view dashboard")
- Keep slices small enough to deliver in 2–4 days, but large enough to deliver value
- **WIP limit** = 1–2 slices max
- Weekly backlog grooming ensures priority + avoids drift

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

- ✅ Unit tests for all core utilities
- ✅ Integration tests per slice (form + API flow)
- 🟡 **E2E tests** (Playwright/Cypress) for login, dashboard, habit tracker
- ✅ Code coverage goal: 80%+
- ✅ Co-locate tests: `FeatureForm.tsx ⟶ FeatureForm.test.tsx`

---

## 📈 Monitoring, Logging & Observability

- ✅ **Sentry** for errors
- ✅ **Vercel Analytics** + Web Vitals
- ✅ **Lighthouse CI** for performance and a11y
- Optional: Plan for future tracing (OpenTelemetry, LogRocket)

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- ✅ **Supabase RLS**: Versioned and documented in `schema.sql`
- ✅ **JWT validation** in shared `core/auth.ts`
- ✅ **Secure cookies/headers** via Vercel middleware
- 🧪 Test critical flows (auth bypass, RLS breach attempts)
